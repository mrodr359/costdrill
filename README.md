CostDrill is an open-source Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool that provides interactive, drill-down visibility into AWS cloud costs. Navigate your cloud billing with a beautiful Text User Interface (TUI) without leaving your terminal.

## Features

### üé® Beautiful TUI Interface
- **Interactive Navigation**: Browse AWS services with an intuitive text-based interface
- **Real-time Data**: View live cost data with loading indicators and auto-refresh
- **Dark Theme**: Eye-friendly color scheme optimized for terminal use
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to your terminal size

### üí∞ Comprehensive EC2 Cost Analysis
- **Regional Overview**: See all EC2 instances with total costs, running/stopped counts
- **Detailed Breakdowns**: 6-category cost analysis (compute, storage, data transfer, snapshots, EIPs, other)
- **Per-Instance Metrics**: View hourly, daily, and monthly cost projections
- **Instance Metadata**: Complete instance details (type, state, VPC, IPs, tags, volumes)

### üîç Smart Cost Discovery
- **Sortable Tables**: Click through instances to explore details
- **Color-Coded States**: Instant visual feedback (green=running, red=stopped)
- **Tag Support**: Filter and organize by your tagging strategy
- **Optimization Hints**: Identify idle resources and cost waste

### ‚ö° Performance & Reliability
- **Built-in Caching**: Sub-5-second response times with intelligent caching
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with retry mechanisms
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking UI during data fetches
- **Credential Validation**: Automatic AWS authentication verification

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- AWS account with Cost Explorer enabled
- AWS credentials configured (via AWS CLI or environment variables)

### Install from PyPI (Coming Soon)

```bash
pip install costdrill
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrodr359/costdrill.git
cd costdrill
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure AWS Credentials

Ensure your AWS credentials are configured. You can use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Or set environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### 2. Launch CostDrill

```bash
costdrill
```

### 3. Navigate the TUI

The interactive TUI provides a beautiful interface to explore your AWS costs:

1. **Home Screen**: Select from available AWS services (EC2 is fully implemented)
2. **EC2 List View**: View all instances with costs, regional statistics, and filters
3. **EC2 Detail View**: Drill down into individual instances for complete breakdowns

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `‚Üë‚Üì` - Navigate menus and tables
- `Enter` - Select / View details
- `r` - Refresh data
- `q` - Go back / Quit
- `d` - Toggle dark mode

**What You'll See:**
- Regional statistics (total instances, running, stopped, total cost)
- Instance list with cost data (30-day totals and daily averages)
- Color-coded instance states (üü¢ running, üî¥ stopped)
- Detailed cost breakdowns (compute, storage, data transfer, etc.)
- Instance metadata (type, launch time, VPC, IPs, tags)
- EBS volume information

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Mode

```bash
# Launch the interactive TUI
costdrill

# Start with a specific service
costdrill --service ec2

# Focus on a specific region
costdrill --region us-west-2
```

### Command-Line Mode

```bash
# Get costs for a specific EC2 instance
costdrill ec2 --instance i-1234567890abcdef0 --output json

# Aggregate all EC2 costs in a region
costdrill ec2 --region us-east-1 --aggregate

# Export report
costdrill ec2 --export costs_report.csv
```

## Architecture

CostDrill follows a modular architecture:

```
costdrill/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/       # AWS API interactions and data fetching
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tui/        # Textual-based user interface components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exporters/  # Report generation (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/      # Helper functions and utilities
```

## Development
